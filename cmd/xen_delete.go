	Short: "Run shell command with arguments in 'delete' action on 'xen' mode",
	Long: `
Run shell command with arguments in 'delete' action on 'xen' mode. For example:

eveadm xen delete ps x`,
	Run: func(cmd *cobra.Command, args []string) {
		fmt.Println("xen delete called")
		run(Timeout, args)

	// Here you will define your flags and configuration settings.

	// Cobra supports Persistent Flags which will work for this command
	// and all subcommands, e.g.:
	// xenDeleteCmd.PersistentFlags().String("foo", "", "A help for foo")

	// Cobra supports local flags which will only run when this command
	// is called directly, e.g.:
	// xenDeleteCmd.Flags().BoolP("toggle", "t", false, "Help message for toggle")
}
